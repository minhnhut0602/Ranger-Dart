------------ Working on ---------------------
  
Json file loading (for particle systems)

------------ Needs Testing ---------------------
Test Rectangle booleans and visually display.

------------ TODO ---------------------
Culling:
Initial version is simple viewport culling.
Advanced Quadtree visibility culling.

AssetManagement: See http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/asset_pack

Fullscreen

App Control: applicationDidBecomeActive etc...
Textures
Opacity cascading
Space mapping for UIKit to OpenGL and back
  convertToUI
  convertToLocationInView

Transitions:
Complete transition system, notebly webgl.

Physics:
  Rocket
  Tracking

Effects:
 
Zones: Zone zooming from Uuchukichi code.
  Circle, Square

------------ Skipping ---------------------
Components: Probably skip, not really needed yet.

------------ Stable/Done ---------------------
Object pools:

http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/handle_system
http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/free_list

Sprite/Textures.

-- DONE Use a StreamController to build a publish/subscribe framework similar
to Cocos2D's. Create as a Mixin perhaps.
Here is an example:

------------ XCode ---------------------

------------ Concepts ---------------------
  mixin for Canvas2D behaviors and WebGL behaviors
  For example, drawLine is different for each renderer.

------------ Game concepts ---------------------
--- Tumbler Game:
The idea is to have a player running and jumping over boulders
tumbling down a hill.
The game could use sprites for the boulders with different sprites
for different directions.
Social aspect is players competing live with each other.
